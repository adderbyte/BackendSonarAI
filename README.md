# BackendSonarAI


## run model

python sonar_deploy_docker.py



### then this one
serve run sonar_deploy_docker:sonarllm




### Models

We will try several model. And scripts for the models are already 
in the model to be identified by the words after the "underscore"
of the files ending starting with name "sonar"


The models are currently being added depeding on different tools available
out there.


Each model was tested it is own python env - so they have different requirement file.
The requirement file has the installation requirement.

### Comment on Yival

Yival is not compatible with Ray. So maybe to try it out with only FastAPI

### Status

Currently it is open to testing but performance update is currently ongoing.
